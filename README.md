- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Phyton
- ðŸ¥… 2024 Goals: find myself
- âš¡ Some facts: I've been working in an advertisement before Covid-19 times, but I've always been fascinated by the Technology world.
-  I enjoy meeting new people a bit more than working with computers. 
Probably, that's also the reason why I'm still in love with portrait photography.
