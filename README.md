## Iâ€™m a Talent Sourcer!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Catawiki 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Phyton
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: Study and contribute to Opensource projects! 
- âš¡ Some facts: I've been working in an advertisement before Covid-19 times, but I've always been fascinated by the Technology world. I've decided to go for Talent Sourcing as I enjoy meeting new people a bit more than working with computers. 

Probably, that's also the reason why I'm still in love with portrait photography.
